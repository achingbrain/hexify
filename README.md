Do you need to easily turn files into hex arrays for your JavaScript unit tests?  Me too.

Demo
-----

`git clone http://github.com/achingbrain/hexify.git && cd hexify && npm install && grunt run` too much like hard work?  [Help is at hand](http://achingbrain.github.com/hexify).  Open that url and skip to step 4 below.

Getting started
-----

1. Install dependencies
	npm install

2. Run web server
	grunt run

3. Open http://localhost:8070

4. Drag a file into the window, wait for it to turn green and release.

5. Copy and paste the output into your unit test.
